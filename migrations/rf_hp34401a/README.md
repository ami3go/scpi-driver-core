The public Robot adapter delegates SCPI measurement behavior to the reviewed `hp34401a_dmm` core. It rejects overload, invalid, missing, and unstable readings instead of returning plausible fabricated values. Hardware connection never silently falls back to simulation.

## Current remediation status

The 2026-08-16 deep review found cross-file and release-governance defects that were not visible in the earlier high-level review. The `dev` branch now includes corrections for:

- repository-root GitHub Actions CI/HIL/Pages workflows;
- fail-closed RFDS-008 evidence run status and manifest-stable diagnostic export;
- listener cleanup evidence finalization and correct simulation/real-hardware evidence mode;
- published evidence-schema regression validation;
- Draft 2020-12 RFDS-014 schema validation and structured schema-lock verification;
- effective runtime application of imported timeout/retry/safety/logging/simulation/device settings;
- finite-positive communication timeout enforcement;
- structured public validation errors while preserving ordinary DUT assertion failures;
- last-known communication health in both `Get Connection State` and `List Connections`;
- RFDS-013 capability/runtime-model synchronization and real Robot export validation;
- facade-aware RFDS-002/RFDS-017/RFDS-019 validators and generators;
- mandatory `rfds-core` version checking/reporting;
- installed-wheel plugin artifact resolution;
- per-operation operator authorization for GUI raw-SCPI Query/Write controls;
- version-derived release building, stale-release-evidence invalidation, and removal of committed generated MkDocs `site/` output;
- synchronized 26.07 compatibility/API-diff/traceability records and the missing v26.07 retrospective code-review record.

The package **does not yet claim full RFDS-003 conformance**. The connected repository/environment does not provide the authoritative shared `rfds-core` implementation needed to integrate `BaseInstrumentLibrary` safely. A local compatibility copy is intentionally not created.

## Install

From the extracted driver directory containing `pyproject.toml`:

```powershell
uv pip install -e ".[hardware]"
```

or:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[hardware]"
```

An approved `rfds-core>=1.0,<2.0` distribution must be available to the package installer. Real VISA/GPIB access additionally requires a VISA implementation such as Keysight IO Libraries Suite or NI-VISA.

Development environment:

```powershell
uv pip install -e ".[dev,hardware]"
```

## Canonical RFDS-002 lifecycle

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Library           rf_hp34401a.Hp34401ALibrary
Suite Teardown    Disconnect All

*** Test Cases ***
Measure A Real DC Voltage
    ${state}=    Connect
    ...    resource=GPIB0::22::INSTR
    ...    alias=dmm
    ...    timeout_s=10 s
    ...    transport=VISA
    Should Be True    ${state}[connected]
    Should Be True    ${state}[communication_ok]

    ${identity}=    Get Identity    alias=dmm
    Log    ${identity}

    ${voltage}=    Measure DC Voltage
    ...    range_value=100
    ...    nplc=10
    ...    alias=dmm
    DMM Reading Should Be Between    11.5    12.5    alias=dmm
```

The ten universal keywords are:

1. `Connect`
2. `Disconnect`
3. `Is Connected`
4. `Get Connection State`
5. `Check Communication`
6. `Get Identity`
7. `Get Driver Information`
8. `Get Driver Capabilities`
9. `Set Communication Timeout`
10. `Get Communication Timeout`

Compatibility names such as `Connect DMM`, `Open DMM Via VISA`, `Open DMM Via Serial`, `Close DMM`, and `Identify DMM` remain available.

### Connection health semantics

`connected` means the session/transport is still open. `communication_ok` is the last-known communication result. After a failed bounded communication check, an alias may correctly report:

```text
connected=True
communication_ok=False
```

That last-known result is preserved in both `Get Connection State` and `List Connections`; an open transport is not automatically treated as healthy.

### `verify_identity` semantics

`verify_identity=False` disables the model-validation step performed during transport connection. Canonical `Connect` still performs the bounded RFDS-002 communication probe required to populate `communication_ok`; therefore it may still issue a safe `*IDN?` probe before returning.

## RFDS-014 configuration

Configuration import is host-side only and does not open hardware or write instrument non-volatile state.

```robotframework
${default}=       Get Driver Default Configuration
${validation}=    Validate Driver Configuration    ${default}
${effective}=     Import Driver Configuration      ${default}
${json}=          Export Driver Configuration
```

Configuration is validated against `config/schema.json`; the schema SHA-256 is verified against the structured `config/schema.lock` before a `ConfigurationManager` is created.

A validated imported profile can control:

- transport resource and transport kind;
- communication, self-test and long-measurement timeouts;
- safe query retry policy;
- raw traffic logging;
- explicit simulation selection and deterministic reading/identity;
- raw-SCPI and calibration authorization;
- expected model/terminal policy.

Package-default simulation is disabled. An omitted resource can select simulation only when a validated imported profile explicitly sets `settings.simulation.enabled=true`; a failed or missing real hardware resource is never replaced by simulation.

The current configuration schema version is exactly `1.0.0`; no automatic cross-version migration engine exists. Different schema versions are rejected instead of guessed.

## RFDS-013 capabilities

```robotframework
${ids}=      Get Driver Capabilities
${model}=    Get Driver Capability Model    mode=static
${matches}=  Find Driver Capabilities    capability_id=measure.    maximum_risk=low
```

Capability binding validation compares the RFDS model to the actual decorated inherited Robot export surface rather than validating the model against itself.

## Logging and evidence

Every public keyword call is recorded as RFDS-008 structured evidence under:

```text
results/session/rf_hp34401a/<run>/
```

The evidence engine records operation arguments/results/failures, identity/environment information, and correlated SCPI protocol traffic. Important fail-closed behavior:

- any failed operation keeps the final run status at `FAIL` even if later cleanup succeeds;
- simulation is labeled `SIMULATION`, not real hardware;
- listener cleanup finalizes the run if an explicit disconnect was omitted;
- diagnostic bundle export writes the export event before hashing the snapshot, so the live manifest remains valid;
- finalized emitted evidence is regression-validated against `schemas/evidence/*.schema.json`.

Disable evidence explicitly only when required:

```robotframework
Library    rf_hp34401a.Hp34401ALibrary    evidence_enabled=${FALSE}
```

Validate evidence:

```console
python scripts/validate_evidence.py results/session/rf_hp34401a/<run>/
```

## GUI raw-SCPI service authorization

The Tkinter GUI remains available through `hp34401a_gui.app`. Its mature implementation is preserved in `hp34401a_gui/legacy_app.py`; the active launcher wraps only the two raw-SCPI controls.

Every raw `Query` or `Write` button action requires a fresh operator confirmation warning that the operation can change instrument state and bypass high-level measurement sequencing. Declining the prompt sends no raw command. Calibration commands remain separately guarded by the core driver.

## RFDS-019 and HIL

Static call/protocol validation:

```powershell
python scripts/validate_ai_contract.py
python scripts/validate_call_protocol_conformance.py
python scripts/generate_conformance_data.py --check
.\scripts\run_call_protocol_conformance.ps1
```

Real-hardware all-public-API verification:

```powershell
.\scripts\run_all_api_hil.ps1 -VisaResource "GPIB0::22::INSTR"
```

The HIL suite inventories all 109 public keywords and requires explicit fixture/authorization profiles for operations that can disturb the DUT or instrument. Simulation evidence is never accepted as a substitute for D2/P1 physical evidence.

## CI and GitHub Pages

Active repository-root workflows are:

```text
.github/workflows/rf_hp34401a-ci.yml
.github/workflows/rf_hp34401a-hil.yml
.github/workflows/rf_hp34401a-pages.yml
```

The software-quality matrix runs on Windows/Linux and Python 3.10/3.13. It performs static contract/generator checks, Python/Robot tests, >=80% combined adapter+core coverage, offline examples, Libdoc, strict MkDocs build, wheel/sdist build, and installed-wheel plugin-resource validation.

The RFDS-003 shared-core release condition is a **separate release-gate job** after the software-quality matrix. That makes it explicit whether the driver itself is green while still preventing release qualification when the authoritative `rfds-core` implementation/version is unavailable.

GitHub Pages builds `site/` from `docs/` and `mkdocs.yml`; generated `site/` output is not tracked in Git.

## Release packaging

`scripts/build_release.py` derives release/distribution versions from the package authorities. It refuses to package a current release when required history/review records are missing and regenerates provenance/checksums from the frozen source commit.

Current `release/` files are deliberately marked as remediation/pending where evidence has not been regenerated. Do not treat them as a production release attestation until software CI, the authoritative shared-core gate, and real HIL have completed on the exact frozen commit.

## Safety

- Verify the selected front/rear input terminal before energizing the fixture.
- Current tests require the correct fused current terminal and an approved bounded source.
- Resistance, continuity and diode tests require a verified de-energized DUT.
- Reset and self-test can disturb a production setup and require explicit authorization/profile enablement.
- Robot raw SCPI is disabled by package default and must be explicitly enabled by constructor, keyword, or validated safety profile.
- GUI raw Query/Write requires a fresh operator authorization for each service operation.
- Calibration commands are separately guarded.
- The RFDS-018 bench file is a template, not a claim about actual bench wiring or limits.
